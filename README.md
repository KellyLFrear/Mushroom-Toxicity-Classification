# Mushroom-Toxicity-Classification
A machine learning project exploring whether visual features in mushroom images can be used to predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or non-poisonous.
This project uses Python, traditional ML models, and YOLOv8 for deep-learning image classification.

This project investigates the question:
**Can mushroom images be used to accurately predict toxicity based on visual features alone?**

We tested this by analyzing a mushroom image dataset, performing EDA, and training classification models (including YOLOv8 and Resnet50).
Our hypothesis:
Visual features in mushroom images cannot be used to accurately predict toxicity.

Our results supported this conclusion, models achieved only 50–70% accuracy, showing that appearance alone is not a reliable indicator.
